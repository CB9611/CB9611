# Hi, I’m Cameron 👋

### Frontend Developer (React.js) | IT Systems & IAM Specialist

I’m an IT professional turned **Frontend Developer** who bridges the gap between enterprise infrastructure and modern user experiences. With a background in managing high-availability systems like Active Directory and VMware, I bring a unique 'systems-first' perspective to my code. My most notable achievement was designing the React-based interface for the IMASS platform, a project that directly helped secure **$8,000,000** in federal funding for my university. I don’t just build interfaces; I build scalable solutions that drive real-world results.

### 🚀 The "8-Million Dollar" Project: IMASS
My work focuses on the intersection of **Legacy Modernization** and **Cloud Integration**. 
* **Key Achievement:** Architected and developed the interface for the **IMASS** project, which successfully containerized legacy Fortran models.
* **Impact:** This modernization effort was the catalyst in securing **$8M in Congressional funding** for my university.
